"Know something, Help Others" I believe this theory. And for this reason I wanted to share my knowledge with others. This to inform you that I have tried my best to solve the urionlinejudge problem according to my own way. Here this is the information for to know that I have uploaded this codes according to the apache free lichense. If anyone want to use this code for his personal purpose it is completely free. Before using the codes please inform me be following email or twitter so that I can be assure that I am helping a  peroson for developing his/her  skill and I think that this will inspire me to do work for general people in future. I want to suggest you not to go through the code before knowing the logic lying behind the solution. If you do that it will be very bad for you because this will damage your creativity and power of  thinking. The best way to do well in c language that you must have to analyse the problem before solving that is called algorithm. BEst wishes for your programming skill.
